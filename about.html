        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>Providing comfort, care, and a warm learning environment for every child.</p>

        <p>
          Dahir Family Childcare began with a simple intention: to create a warm, nurturing, and safe space 
          where children feel truly at home. We believe every child deserves individual attention, gentle guidance, 
          and opportunities to grow at their own pace.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also understand the challenges families face—especially parents who work unconventional or extended hours. 
          Many parents struggle to find reliable night-time or early-morning care, which is why we chose to offer flexible 
          and dependable support around the clock.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, our childcare home has grown into a place filled with curiosity, creativity, and joyful learning. 
          We designed our environment intentionally: small, safe, structured, and welcoming. Each day is centered around 
          building confidence, encouraging exploration, and helping children feel seen and supported.
        </p>

        <p>
          We proudly offer <strong>24/7 child care</strong> for families with rotating shifts, late-night jobs, 
          early-morning responsibilities, or irregular schedules.

    <h1 class="care-title">Daily Care &amp; Routines</h1>

    <p class="care-intro">
      Kids in different age groups learn and grow in ways unique to them. We understand that and use different
      interaction styles and activities to support their social growth and engagement. We also believe rest is
      essential, so we offer calm, structured daily rest periods to help children recharge. To support physical
      well-being, we follow weather-appropriate guidelines and adjust outdoor time based on conditions. When
      temperatures are 55°F or below, children wear light jackets before playing outside so they can stay warm and
      comfortable.
    </p>
